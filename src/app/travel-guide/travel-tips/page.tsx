          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">
            The cash or cards you carry on a trip are prone to loss and theft. You would certainly
            not want to run out of money or dilute the pleasure by landing into such situations.
            Avoid it with the following tips:

            <li className="text-gray-700">
              <span className="font-bold text-gray-900">Avoid Back Pockets for Wallets:</span> Do
              you know how to keep your bank cards in your purse or wallet? Well stay away from this
              habit while you are on a trip. Keep at least separate places. Imagine how it would be
              hard to get replacement if you lose all your cards. And above it running out of money
              in the middle of a trip can really kill enjoyment.

            <li className="text-gray-700">
              <span className="font-bold text-gray-900">Keep at Different Places:</span> Get in the
              practice of looking back when you are about to leave somewhere. Trip to a place would
              be distracting, and you are possibly carrying more stuff, so it might be possible you
              may forget your jacket or any other valuable. So look back and ensure you're not
              leaving anything there.

            <li className="text-gray-700">
              <span className="font-bold text-gray-900">Don't Use Cards Everywhere:</span> Scan all
              you major travel documents and keep a copy in your email. Take a hard copy of your
              passport, travel insurance, visa etc and keep these all in a separate section of your
              luggage. Though it's a traditional practice you can consider the digital way also.
